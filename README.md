# Blackjack - JavaScript Exercise

Just another simple excercise with javascript from Scrimba Front End Developer -course. Uses Math.random() -static method to draw random cards from the deck and keep tracking when exceeding 21. Applies scores so the ace is 11 and jack, queen and king counts as 10. Number cards have their face value.
